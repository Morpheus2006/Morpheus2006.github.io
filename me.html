        <p>
            My name is Bladimir Miranda, I'm 16 yo and I live in Cancun, Mexico.
            I have Asperger Syndrome, which is among the autism spectrum disorders<br>
            I'm not like the others, but I learned that it's not necessarily bad.
            I may not have the same abilities as others, but I have never stopped striving to fulfill my dreams.
            My dream is to work as a robotics engineer. Since I was a child, my passion has always been to create things, 
            now that I am in high school, that dream becomes more and more a reality. Someday my inventions will change the world and make it a better place
