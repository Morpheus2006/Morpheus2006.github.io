        <h2>Representation of my mind when I close my eyes</h2>
        <h3>In my home</h3>

        <p>I love being at home, specifically in my room, because it's quiet. It is the only place where I feel safe and my mind is clear.</p>
        <h3>In the school</h3>
        <div align="left">
            <img src="in_school.jpg" width="20%" height="20%" alt="" class="photo">
        </div>
        <p>I like to study, but I find it hard to think with so many people in such a small space. The teachers understand me most of the time and are good to me. But I don't have many friends because I don't understand them.</p>
        <h3>In public places</h3>
        <div align="left">
            <img src="in_public_places.jpg" width="20%" height="20%" alt="" class="photo">
        </div>
        <p>It's horrible for me to be in a place full of people, I feel like I'm drowning, my legs are shaking, but I still move them and try to stay calm.</p>
